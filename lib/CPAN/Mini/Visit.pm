CPAN::Mini::Visit - A generalised API version of David Golden's visitcpan

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  CPAN::Mini::Visit->new(
      minicpan => '/minicpan',
      acme     => 0,
      author   => 'ADAMK',
      callback => sub {
          print "# archive: $_[0]->{archive}\n";
          print "# tempdir: $_[0]->{tempdir}\n";
          print "# dist:    $_[0]->{dist}\n";
          print "# author:  $_[0]->{author}\n";
      }
  )->run;
  
  # archive: /minicpan/authors/id/A/AD/ADAMK/Config-Tiny-1.00.tar.gz
  # tempdir: /tmp/1a4YRmFAJ3/Config-Tiny-1.00
  # dist:    ADAMK/Config-Tiny-1.00.tar.gz
  # author:  ADAMK

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<CPAN::Mini::Extract> has been relatively successful at allowing processes
to run across the contents (or a subset of the contents) of an entire
L<minicpan> checkout.

However it has become evident that while it is useful (and theoretically
optimal from a processing point of view) to maintain an expanded minicpan
checkout the sheer size of an expanded minicpan is such that it becomes
an undo burdon to manage, move, copy or even delete a directory tree with
hundreds of thousands of file totalling in the high single gigabytes in size.

Annoyed by this, David Golden created L<visitcpan> which takes an alternative
approach of sequentially expanding the tarball of each distribution into a
temporary directory, do the processing on that distribution, and then delete
the temporary directory before moving on to the next directory.

This method results in a longer computation time, but with the benefit of
dramatically reduced system overhead, greater adaptability, and allow for
easy ad-hoc computations.

This improvement in flexibility turns out to be worth the extra computation
time in almost all cases.

B<CPAN::Mini::Visit> is a simplified and generalised API-based ersion of 
David Golden's L<visitcpan> script.

It implements only the process of discovering, iterating and expanding
archives, before handing off control to an arbitrary callback function
provided to the constructor.

=head2 new

Takes a variety of parameters and creates a new visitor object.

The C<minicpan> param should be the root directory of a L<CPAN::Mini>
download.

The C<callback> param should be a C<CODE> reference that will be called
for each visit. The first parameter passed to the callback will be a C<HASH>
reference containing the tarball location in the C<archive> key, the location
of the temporary directory in the C<tempdir> key, the canonical CPAN
distribution name in the C<dist> key, and the author id in the C<author> key.

The C<acme> param (true by default) can be set to false to exclude any
distributions that contain the string "Acme", allowing the visit to ignore
any of the joke modules.

The C<author> param can be provided to limit the visit to only the modules
owned by a specific author.

Returns a B<CPAN::Mini::Visit> object, or throws an exception on error.

=head2 run

The C<run> method executes the visit process, taking no parameters and
returning true.

Because the object contains no state information, you may call the C<run>
method multiple times for a single visit object with no ill effects.
